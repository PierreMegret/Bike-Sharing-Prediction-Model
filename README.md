# Bike-Sharing-Prediction-Model
## The project Building a predictive model for the total number of hourly bike rentals in the bike sharing network of Washington, D.C.  Python was the programming language for this project. ## The code The code is organized as follow: an exploration of the data, a k-fold cross-validation error to determine the best hyper-parameters of my model, and the predictions. ## The data The dataset provided was hourly rental data spanning two years with an exception of 2 months used as a testing set for predictions. I predicted the total count of bikes rented during each hour for the months of August and December 2012. ## Part 1. Exploration of the data Looked at the features of the data as well as the existence of missing values. ## Part 2. Building of the Model Built a Random Forest Regressor after having tuned it with a k-fold cross-validation. ## Part 3. Predictions and model performances Evaluated the model performances and predicated the total count of bikes rented in the test set.
